# Unity Ballistics Tutorial

Tutorial on how to make realistic bullets in Unity

Notice that the code is not exactly the same as in the tutorial because I've learned some things over the years. But the basic concept is the same. The man change is that I added the factor from the wind in the forces that affects the bullet instead of affecting the velocity of the bullet. This should be more physically accurate. I also added a force called lift.
